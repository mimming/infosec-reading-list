# Infosec Reading List

Here is a reading list of blog posts about information security relevant to someone with a software development background.  

I aim to make this a list of the 200 or so most useful resources I read as I ventured into the world of information security.  This list was inspired by @enocom's awesome [Gopher Reading List](https://github.com/enocom/gopher-reading-list).
